This website uses materialize CSS in it's styling.
This makes it very convienient to make things pretty.
At the current moment the default login is the following
username: admin@psu.edu password: password
This should cause all of the login items to disappear and (eventually) a list to populate below the Navbar with whatever the user
searches which will be on the right where the login prompt was prior to logging in.
