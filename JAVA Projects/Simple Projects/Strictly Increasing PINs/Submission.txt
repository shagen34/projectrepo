2) For the first problem I used the generate string code as reference. I attempted to use constraints @ line 42 based on the PIN prefix being passed to short circuit 
some calls but I'm not sure if they actually help. I was having problems passing a null StringBuilder so I used the if statement which is why I use the special case 
for null PIN prefixes. Runtime complexity depends most on the base chosen(n). = O(2^n) 

For the second problem I used the code for the subset sum as reference. I used a hashtable to store the sums as keys and increment the value of at the key if the sum is
created again. Then traverses the hashtable to find the key with the highest value. Runtime complexity depends the most on the size of the input array(n). = O(2^n) 

For the last problem I used the non-recursive subset sum as reference. Using the same data types as the previous problem to store the sums. 
Runtime complexity also depends most on the size of the input array(n). = O(2^n)
