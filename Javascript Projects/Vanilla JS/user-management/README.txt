Problem Set #2: User Management Problem

- Should have all the required features
- Generated 10 rows of 6 for 60 users total, can filter based on all text contained in the cards, case-insensitive
- Minor Issues:
	- Some characters create a card that is slightly longer than the others and will shift the row below it,
		doesnt affect functionality but is not aesthetic. Can fix this by using fixed height cards instead.
	- Can filter users before all users are generated, can fix with making text box unselectable until all cards have loaded
