Problem Set #2: Weather App

Notes:
- Doesn't display all planned information, only high/lows for each day for next 7 days. 
- Wasn't too sure how to get consistent data without meticulously going through the json file and formatting dates/times,
	I should've asked Prof Melusky about this in class
	(e.g. weather array from api doesnt have weather information for every day)
- I spent more time on the next two problems and they were done much better in my opinion
