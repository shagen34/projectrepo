Problem Set 1: Minesweeper

Notes: 
- Might have some portability issues with small screens, especially with largest game board
- The DOM elements aren't as neatly organized as the hangman problem, didn't give enough time to tidy up the interface
- This game would be very tedious to play, it does not reveal neighbors with 0 adjacent mines,
	I tried to implement that feature but only ended up revealing every tile with 0 adjacent 
	mines instead of the ones adjacent to the clicked tile
